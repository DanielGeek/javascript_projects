# 💻 DanielGeek's JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my JavaScript learning and development repository. This collection includes foundational exercises, algorithm challenges, Webpack tooling, and ECMAScript modern features. It's designed to show progressive mastery of JavaScript — from the basics to advanced data structures and build processes.

---

## ⚙️ Tech & Tools

- **Core JavaScript**: Primitives, control structures, classes, async/await, ES6+ syntax.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Arrays, trees, graphs, sorting, dynamic programming, backtracking.
- **Webpack & Build Tools**: Webpack config from scratch, Babel, Hot Reloading, code splitting.
- **Modern Features**: ECMAScript 6–13, optional chaining, destructuring, default params.
- **Node.js & NPM**: Dependency management and CLI tooling.
